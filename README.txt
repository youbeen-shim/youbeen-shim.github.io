Something that's been on my to-do list forever. My website, utilizing a blog-type format to post/list the things that I've
deemed worthy enough

To-do:
	1. An auto-update program that can automatically re-queue the posts so that the posts are structured in reverse chronological order
		a. Even in multi-page setting (front page)
	2. Updates on posts :P

	3. Finish landing pages for About Me; Highlights; Projects; Blogposts; Interviews
	4. Add articles
	5. Add projects
