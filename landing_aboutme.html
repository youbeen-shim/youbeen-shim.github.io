									 <span class="image left"><img src="images/aboutme_pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>Hey, my name is Youbeen, and I'm a goat whisperer (...)
									 I'm currently working as a quantitative modeler at Fannie Mae, and I build machine learning/deep learning models on AWS infrastructure.
									 I spend majority of my time at work implementing different models that are published, keeping up to date on current ML/DL development, 
									 educating my team on new implementations and AWS tools, evaluating assumptions that went into the model, and modernizing the old data pipeline code.
									 I have an undergraduate degree in Statistics and Computer Science from University of Virginia, and, as my friends can tell you, I have a passionate love for statistics, people, and teaching.
								</p>
								<p>
									 I'm also an immigrant from Korea and a recent a citizen of US, and have spent majority of my college years trying to define my identity and thus a place in this foreign
									 country that I now call home. First step of that plan is complete, but we'll see where my boundless ambition and a knack for not letting failures bother me combined with
									 propencity for procrastination can take me.
									 Slow and steady, as my dad would say.
								</p>
								<p>
									 If I'm not working on my work or my projects, I'm probably spending time reading (historical fictions are my jam), chatting up friends, watching movies, or chilling with my cat on my lap. I especially enjoy talking about ideas, lessons,
									 impressions, and themes so I'll keep a log of things that I've watched/read and enjoyed -please talk to me about this if you'd like. I'm also training for a half marathon! Which
									 I'm pretty excited about.
								</p>
								<p>
									 I've created this website part as a log for the work that I've done, part (hopefully) to guide someone else who wants to work with digging for insights from a random assortment
									 of numbers (or pictures! or words! but we'll get to that later). I don't pretend to be an absolute authority on the things that I write about, but I take great care in trying to
									 be objective and factual and take great pride in making things easier to conceptualize for others.
